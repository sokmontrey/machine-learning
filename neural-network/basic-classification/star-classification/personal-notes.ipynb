    "> model.train() tells your model that you are training the model. This helps inform layers such as Dropout and BatchNorm, which are designed to behave differently during training and evaluation. For instance, in training mode, BatchNorm updates a moving average on each new batch; whereas, for evaluation mode, these updates are frozen."
